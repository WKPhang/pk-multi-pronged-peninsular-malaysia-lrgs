### Introduction
The rise of zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi malaria from wild non-human primate (NHP) populations has become a major public health concern in Malaysia, now serving as the leading cause of human malaria infections in the country. The transmission of malaria caused by P. knowlesi is known to involve the human, non-human primate, and vector. Despite there has been various studies targetting these components separately, there is a lack of overall study combining the field data from these components This study aims at integrating multi-pronged surveillance data of macaques, vectors, and human blood sampling for understanding the knowlesi malaria epidemiology in Peninsular Malaysia. Spatiotemporal correlation analysis was conducted between the sampling events and the recorded human cases within specific distances from the sampling sites. High prevalence of P. knowlesi infections in macaques was observed in high-risk areas of human P. knowlesi malaria with statistically significance. Other simian malaria parasites, P. cynomolgi, P. inui, P. coatneyi and P. fieldi, were found show heterogenous patterns in macaques and the vectors, in the aspect of geographical distribution and mixed-species infection. Integrating insights from epidemiology, ecology, veterinary science, and public health will be key to controlling zoonotic diseases like P. knowlesi and reducing their impact on both human and animal populations.
