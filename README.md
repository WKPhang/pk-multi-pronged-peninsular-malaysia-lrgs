## Introduction
Plasmodium knowlesi, a non-human primate (NHP) malaria, has become a major public health concern in Malaysia and is now the leading cause of human malaria infections in the country. The transmission of P. knowlesi malaria involves a complex cycle among humans, non-human primates, and vectors. Numerous studies have focused on these hosts individually, but comprehensive research that integrates field data from all three hosts is lacking. This study aims to integrate multi-pronged surveillance data from macaques, vectors, and human blood samples to better understand the epidemiology of P. knowlesi malaria in Peninsular Malaysia. Field sampling data (both previously published and unpublished) collected from humans, macaques, and mosquito vectors by this research group in Peninsular Malaysia between 2019 and 2022 were integrated. The data collected for each host type within the same site and same month of the year were aggregated as a single sampling event. Spatiotemporal correlations were analysed between the sampling events and historical human knowlesi malaria cases reported within defined distances (up to 20 km) from the sampling sites at different time windows (range from -12 to 12- month leads). A significantly high proportion of P. knowlesi infections in macaques was observed in areas with a high-risk of human infection. Other NHP malaria parasites - P. cynomolgi, P. inui, P. coatneyi and P. fieldi - exhibited heterogenous patterns in macaques and vectors, particularly in terms of geographical distribution and mixed-species infection. Integrating insights from epidemiology, ecology, veterinary science, and public health will be key in controlling zoonotic diseases such as P. knowlesi malaria and mitigating their impact on both human and animal populations.
